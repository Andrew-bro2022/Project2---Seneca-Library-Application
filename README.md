# Project2---A Modern-Library-Application

**Summary**: 
1. Using C++ to design an application that receives the publications and stores them in the system with the information needed for their retrieval.
   
2. Later, each publication can be lent out to members of the library with a due date for return.
   
3. When Books and other publications arrive in the library, they can be tagged and put on shelves, so they are easily retrievable to be lent out to those who need them.
